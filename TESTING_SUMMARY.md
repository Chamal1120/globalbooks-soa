# GlobalBooks SOA - Testing Summary & Findings

## Overview
This document summarizes all findings from comprehensive testing of the GlobalBooks SOA system after git reset to clean state.

## System Architecture

### Services Running (All ✅)
1. **auth-server** (Port 8081) - User registration & JWT token generation
2. **catalog-service** (Port 8085) - Book catalog with dual authentication
3. **order-orchestration-service** (Port 8086) - Order processing with dual authentication
4. **orders-service** (Port 8087) - Order management
5. **payments-service** (Port 8088) - Payment processing
6. **shipping-service** (Port 8089) - Shipping management

## Authentication Models Discovered

### REST Endpoints (JWT Authentication)

#### ✅ Working with JWT
- **Auth Server**: 
  - `/register` - User registration
  - `/authenticate` - JWT token generation
- **Order Orchestration**: 
  - `/api/orders/process` - Order processing with JWT Bearer token

#### ⚠️ Clean State (No JWT Security)
- **Catalog Service**: 
  - `/api/books/{id}` - Not secured in clean state (JWT components removed during git reset)

### SOAP Endpoints (WS-Security Authentication)

#### ✅ Working with WS-Security Username Token
- **Catalog Service**: `/ws/catalog`
  - Username: `catalog-client`
  - Password: `catalog-secure-2024`
  - Request: `getBookDetailsRequest`
  - Response: `getBookDetailsResponse`

- **Order Orchestration**: `/ws/order-process`
  - Username: `order-client`
  - Password: `order-secure-2024`
  - Request: `ProcessOrderRequest`
  - Response: `ProcessOrderResponse`

## Correct Endpoint Discovery

### Initial Assumptions vs Reality
❌ **Incorrect Assumptions:**
- Auth endpoints: `/auth/register`, `/auth/login`
- Order SOAP: `/ws/orders` or `/ws`

✅ **Actual Endpoints:**
- Auth endpoints: `/register`, `/authenticate`
- Catalog SOAP: `/ws/catalog`
- Order SOAP: `/ws/order-process`

## Test Scripts Updated

### 1. test-1-user-creation.sh
**Purpose:** User registration and JWT token generation
**Updates:**
- Fixed username: `testuser` (consistent across all tests)
- Password: `password123`
- Correct endpoints: `/register`, `/authenticate`
- JWT token saved to `/tmp/globalbooks_jwt_token.txt`

### 2. test-2-rest-order.sh
**Purpose:** REST order processing with JWT authentication
**Updates:**
- Uses JWT token from test 1 or creates new one
- Simplified payload: `{"customerId": "testuser", "bookId": "1", "quantity": 2}`
- Correct endpoint: `/api/orders/process`
- Authorization: `Bearer {JWT_TOKEN}`

### 3. test-3-soap-order.sh
**Purpose:** SOAP order processing with WS-Security
**Updates:**
- Correct endpoint: `/ws/order-process`
- WS-Security credentials: `order-client` / `order-secure-2024`
- Correct request: `ProcessOrderRequest`
- Namespace: `http://globalbooks.com/orders`
- SOAP envelope includes WS-Security header

### 4. test-4-catalog-ws-security.sh
**Purpose:** Catalog service dual authentication testing
**Updates:**
- Correct SOAP endpoint: `/ws/catalog`
- WS-Security credentials: `catalog-client` / `catalog-secure-2024`
- Correct request: `getBookDetailsRequest`
- Tests both REST (no auth in clean state) and SOAP (WS-Security required)

### 5. run-all-tests.sh
**Purpose:** Complete test suite runner
**Updates:**
- Updated to run all 4 tests in sequence
- Proper error handling and result reporting
- Wait periods between tests for stability

## Authentication Flow

### REST Authentication Flow
1. **User Registration:** `POST /register` with username/password
2. **Authentication:** `POST /authenticate` with credentials
3. **JWT Token:** Received in response, valid for 10 hours
4. **API Calls:** Include `Authorization: Bearer {JWT_TOKEN}` header

### SOAP Authentication Flow
1. **WS-Security Header:** Include `wsse:Security` in SOAP header
2. **Username Token:** `wsse:UsernameToken` with username/password
3. **Password Type:** PasswordText (plain text in this implementation)
4. **Validation:** Server validates against hardcoded credentials

## Current System State (Clean State)

### What Works ✅
- User registration and authentication (JWT generation)
- Order orchestration REST API with JWT
- Order orchestration SOAP API with WS-Security
- Catalog service SOAP API with WS-Security
- Catalog service REST API (but without authentication)
- All microservices running and communicating

### What's Missing (Removed in Git Reset) ⚠️
- JWT authentication for catalog REST endpoints
- JWT components were properly removed, returning to baseline

## Security Implementation Summary

### Dual Authentication Model
- **REST Endpoints:** JWT Bearer tokens (where implemented)
- **SOAP Endpoints:** WS-Security Username Token authentication
- **Clean Separation:** SOAP uses interceptors, REST uses filters
- **No Interference:** Changes to one don't affect the other

### Hardcoded Credentials (For Testing)
```
Catalog Service SOAP:
  Username: catalog-client
  Password: catalog-secure-2024

Order Orchestration SOAP:
  Username: order-client
  Password: order-secure-2024
```

## Test Execution Results

### Manual Testing Completed ✅
1. User registration: `testuser` / `password123`
2. JWT token generation and validation
3. Order orchestration REST with JWT
4. Order orchestration SOAP with WS-Security
5. Catalog service SOAP with WS-Security
6. Catalog service REST (working but not secured in clean state)

### All Endpoints Verified ✅
- All services responding on correct ports
- Authentication mechanisms working as designed
- Data consistency between REST and SOAP endpoints
- Proper error handling for unauthorized requests

## Recommendations

### For Production Deployment
1. **Replace hardcoded credentials** with configurable authentication
2. **Implement JWT authentication** for catalog REST endpoints if required
3. **Add proper certificate-based WS-Security** instead of plain text passwords
4. **Implement proper error handling** and logging
5. **Add API rate limiting** and monitoring

### For Development
1. **Run updated test scripts** to validate any changes
2. **Use consistent usernames** across tests (now `testuser`)
3. **Implement environment-specific configuration** for credentials
4. **Add integration tests** for service-to-service communication

## Files Updated
- `tests/test-1-user-creation.sh`
- `tests/test-2-rest-order.sh`
- `tests/test-3-soap-order.sh`
- `tests/test-4-catalog-ws-security.sh`
- `tests/run-all-tests.sh`
- `TESTING_SUMMARY.md` (this file)

## Conclusion

The GlobalBooks SOA system is **fully functional** in its clean state with a **dual authentication model**:
- **REST endpoints** use JWT authentication (where implemented)
- **SOAP endpoints** use WS-Security Username Token authentication
- **All test scripts updated** with correct endpoints and authentication
- **Complete testing workflow** established for validation

The system demonstrates a robust SOA architecture with proper separation of concerns, dual authentication models, and comprehensive testing coverage.
