# GlobalBooks SOA Governance Policy

## Version: 1.0
## Effective Date: September 2025
## Owner: GlobalBooks Inc.

---

## 1. Service Versioning Strategy

### 1.1 URL Versioning Convention
All services must implement URL-based versioning using the following pattern:
```
{protocol}://{host}:{port}/api/v{major_version}/{service_name}
```

**Examples:**
- `http://localhost:8082/api/v1/orders`
- `http://localhost:8085/ws/v1/catalog`

### 1.2 Namespace Versioning (SOAP Services)
SOAP services must implement namespace versioning:
```xml
http://catalog.globalbooks.com/v1/
http://orders.globalbooks.com/v1/
```

### 1.3 Semantic Versioning Rules
- **Major Version (X.0.0):** Breaking changes requiring client updates
- **Minor Version (X.Y.0):** Backward-compatible feature additions
- **Patch Version (X.Y.Z):** Backward-compatible bug fixes

### 1.4 Version Lifecycle
- **Current Version:** Actively maintained with full support
- **Previous Version:** Maintained for 12 months after new major release
- **Deprecated Version:** 6-month notice before sunset

## 2. Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

### 2.1 Availability Targets
| Service Tier | Availability | Max Downtime/Month |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Critical     | 99.9%        | 43.2 minutes      |
| Standard     | 99.5%        | 3.6 hours         |
| Development  | 95.0%        | 36 hours          |

**Service Tier Classifications:**
- **Critical:** Auth Server, Order Orchestration
- **Standard:** Catalog Service, Orders Service, Payments Service, Shipping Service
- **Development:** Test environments

### 2.2 Performance Targets
| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Response Time | < 200ms | 95th percentile |
| Throughput | > 1000 req/sec | Peak load |
| Error Rate | < 0.1% | Over 24-hour period |

### 2.3 Scalability Requirements
- **Horizontal Scaling:** All services must support horizontal scaling
- **Load Distribution:** Services must handle traffic distribution across multiple instances
- **Auto-scaling:** Services should implement auto-scaling based on CPU/memory metrics

## 3. Deprecation and Sunset Process

### 3.1 Deprecation Notice Period
| Change Type | Notice Period | Communication Channels |
|-------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Minor API Changes | 30 days | Email, API headers |
| Major Version Updates | 90 days | Email, documentation |
| Service Retirement | 12 months | All channels + meetings |

### 3.2 Sunset Process
1. **Announcement:** Formal communication to all stakeholders
2. **Migration Period:** Parallel operation of old and new versions
3. **Monitoring:** Track usage of deprecated endpoints
4. **Final Notice:** 30-day final warning before sunset
5. **Decommission:** Complete removal of deprecated services

### 3.3 Communication Protocol
- **Primary Channel:** Email to registered API consumers
- **Secondary Channels:** API documentation, HTTP headers
- **Emergency Changes:** Direct contact + immediate notification

---

## 4. Security Governance

### 4.1 Authentication Standards
- **REST Services:** JWT tokens with 1-hour expiration
- **SOAP Services:** WS-Security with UsernameToken or X.509 certificates

### 4.2 Authorization Framework
- **Audit Logging:** All access attempts logged and monitored

### 4.3 Data Protection
- **Encryption in Transit:** TLS 1.3 minimum for all communications
- **Encryption at Rest:** secure encryption for sensitive data storage

---

## 5. Quality of Service (QoS)

### 5.1 Reliable Messaging
- **Message Persistence:** Critical messages stored persistently
- **Delivery Guarantees:** At-least-once delivery for order processing
- **Dead Letter Queues:** Failed messages routed to DLQ for analysis

### 5.2 Circuit Breaker Pattern
- **Failure Threshold:** 5 consecutive failures trigger circuit open
- **Timeout Period:** 30-second timeout before retry attempt
- **Health Check:** Automated health checks every 10 seconds

### 5.3 Monitoring and Observability
- **Health Endpoints:** `/health` on all services
- **Metrics Collection:** Prometheus-compatible metrics
- **Distributed Tracing:** Correlation IDs for request tracking

---

## 6. Integration Standards

### 6.1 Message Format Standards
- **REST:** JSON with RFC 7807 problem details for errors
- **SOAP:** XML Schema validation required
- **Async Messaging:** CloudEvents format for event payloads

### 6.2 Error Handling
- **HTTP Status Codes:** Consistent use across all REST services
- **Error Response Format:** Standardized error structure
- **Retry Logic:** Exponential backoff with jitter

### 6.3 Service Discovery
- **Registry:** UDDI entries for service discovery
- **Health Checks:** Automated registration/deregistration based on health

---

## 7. Development and Deployment

### 7.1 Code Quality Standards
- **Test Coverage:** Minimum 80% unit test coverage
- **Integration Tests:** Required for all external service interactions
- **Code Review:** Mandatory peer review for all changes

### 7.2 Deployment Pipeline
- **Blue-Green Deployment:** Zero-downtime deployments
- **Rollback Capability:** Automated rollback on deployment failures

### 7.3 Environment Management
- **Development:** Local Docker Compose setup
- **Staging:** Production-like environment for testing
- **Production:** High-availability clustered deployment

---

## 8. Compliance and Audit

### 8.1 Regulatory Compliance
- **PCI DSS:** For payment processing services
- **GDPR:** For customer data handling
- **SOX:** For financial reporting systems

### 8.2 Audit Requirements
- **Access Logs:** Retained for 2 years
- **Change Logs:** All configuration changes tracked
- **Performance Metrics:** Historical data for capacity planning

### 8.3 Review Cycle

- **Quarterly:** Security and compliance audit
- **Annually:** Complete governance policy review

---

## 9. Governance Enforcement

### 9.1 Policy Violations
- **Automated Detection:** Policy violations detected through monitoring
- **Escalation Process:** Defined escalation path for violations
- **Remediation:** Required fixes within defined timeframes
